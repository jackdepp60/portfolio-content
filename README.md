These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

Projects:
[Car Insurance]
[Code-First Student Registry]

Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

Code-First Student Registry
This project is about coding the logic and class while connecting and creating the database in the background/abstract. Without manually creating the database connection using interfaces. This is what the code-first method is about.
